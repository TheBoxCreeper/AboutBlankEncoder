## Ruffle Scripts, Warning when tab closed, and Dynamic tabs
Enable the checkboxes to turn on these features
Ruffle scripts allows any flash file (.swf files) from a website to be embedded and run. This is for non-dynamic tabs.
The warning box shows a warning when the tab is closed instead of closing the tab.
The dyamic tabs box enables dynamic tabs. Change the features of the tab without changing the URL.
## Body and Head html
This requires enc-html-insertion to be enabled.
Insert head html in the head html textarea.
Insert body html when the encode html code in the body instead of an URL box is checked in the body html textarea. This disables dynamic tabs and URL input.
## Ruffle in dynamic tabs
To use Ruffle, you must first replace the url with the flash url.
Next, check the checkbox.
To disable Ruffle, you must first uncheck the checkbox.
Next, you should replace the flash url with the new url.
**Doing these steps out of order could lead to an unfixable crash in Ruffle.**
